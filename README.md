# VFCA - Vehicles Fuel Consumption Analysis

In order to control and analyze fuel consumption the VFCA works using three phases of operations as
shown in Fig 1. Phase 1 uses an AI model to predict your vehicle’s overall fuel consumption
according to the chosen features and metrics of the model. The prediction helps in phase 2 to
calculate the different vehicle trips exact fuel consumption and overall time and at the same time,
it considers choosing the shorter routes with fewer jams. Then to reduce the calculated fuel
consumption in phase 3, the driver’s behavior is analyzed using an AI model to predict if he is a
high, medium or low fuel consumer then gives the driver the tips to switch to the most efficient low
fuel consumption category. Then it provides effective solutions for the user of fuel recommendation
system and fuel quote management which proposes a way for tracking usage effectively and
conservation of money and the used fuel across daily vehicle trips.

## Application Features
